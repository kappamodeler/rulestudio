# Welcome to the Kappa Workbench Editor 
# 
# This editor will improve the speed of entering valid kappa by using auto completion and basic syntax checking as you write each line.
# Auto completion of agents, rules and Kappa will drop down when you are creating initial conditions, observables or rules that reuse agents in prior rules.
# 
# Please send comments and feedback on our editor to eclipse@cellucidate.com
